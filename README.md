## Communication Settings

Communication in multiplayer games is very important. By providing differend ways to communicate with other players you can increase the accessibility of your game and players comfort.

##### Voice Chat
Allow players to enable or disable voice chat from the Accessibility menu. Provide separate options to select input and output devices.

##### Voice Chat Input
Offer choices for push-to-talk, always-on, or no transmission.

##### Text-to-Speech (TTS)
Enable TTS to narrate typed text over voice chat for other players.
Allow players to choose between male or female TTS voices.

##### Predefined phrases (with voice acting or TTS)
As a additional help, you can add premade phrases to choose from, like:
- I saw enemy.
- Help me.
- I'm going back.
- Are you ok?

## Speech-to-Text (STT)
Convert player speech via voice chat to written text. It will help people with hearing problems and minimalize misunderstandings.

## Screen Narration
Enable screen narration (where available) for menus and gameplay. Help visually imparied people navigate through options easier. Prioritize narration for communication pathways (e.g., login flow, squad creation, game start, and settings). Note that not all menus and UI elements may be narrated initially.

## Subtitles
Subtitles can help be aware of what happening and understand the world around the players with hearing problems

##### Subtitles
Display spoken dialogue as text.

##### Closed Captioning
Subset of sounds displayed as text (may not cover all game sound effects).
Include an option to show speaker names in subtitles.

## Font Scaling
Allow players to adjust font size (e.g., scale from 100% to 150%). This will help with readabillity of the labels or texts even on high resolution screens.

## Field of View (FOV)
Let players customize FOV (60 to 120) while considering performance impact.

## Mono Audio
Allow players to switch to mono audio output. This is especially helpful for players with hearing impairments who may struggle with stereo separation.

## High Contrast Mode
Enable a high contrast mode for players with visual impairments.
Provide options to adjust background and text colors to enhance readability.

## Limited Light Flickers
Minimize or eliminate rapid light flickers, as they can trigger seizures or discomfort for players with photosensitive epilepsy.

## Color-Blind Settings
Offer color-blind modes that adjust game visuals to accommodate different types of color blindness (e.g., red-green, blue-yellow, or total color blindness).
Use distinct shapes or patterns in addition to color cues for critical game elements (e.g., health bars, objectives, enemies).

## Limited-Keys Mode for Controls
Allow players to customize controls by remapping keys or buttons.
Provide presets for limited-keys mode, reducing the number of required inputs for players with mobility impairments.

## High Contrast Textures
Implement high contrast textures for game elements (e.g., characters, objects, terrain) to improve visibility.
